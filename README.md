# 🎬 Landing Page Product Analytics – AWS · Power BI · Statistical Experimentation
All content shown here has been recreated with synthetic and anonymized data in compliance with confidentiality agreements.
## 🎯 Overview  

This project focused on analyzing the **performance and user engagement** of my company’s **landing page**, which serves as a critical entry point for user conversion and content discovery.  

The initiative was led in collaboration with the **audiovisual production team**, who aimed to identify which page elements (videos, visuals, or text) increased user retention and interaction.  

The project combined **data scraping, relational modeling, inferential statistics, and dashboard visualization** to deliver actionable insights that informed both **creative design and product strategy**.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow  

### **1️⃣ Requirement Mapping**
- Conducted a **needs assessment** with the audiovisual production and web development teams to understand data availability and experimentation goals.  
- Identified key user actions and conversion triggers for analysis (clicks, dwell time, video views, and bounce rate).  

🧰 *Tools:* Interviews · Stakeholder Workshops · Figma (metric sketching)  

---

### **2️⃣ KPI Design & Approval**
- Proposed a set of **core KPIs** focused on engagement and retention:
  - Performance of landing page contents
  - Avg. Watch Time
  - Conversion Funnel Drop-offs
  - Revenue Share per Partner  
- Presented these metrics to stakeholders for validation prior to data collection.  

🧰 *Tools:* Power BI · Excel · Miro  

---

### **3️⃣ Statistical Analysis & Sampling**
- Applied **stratified sampling** to ensure balanced representation of users and sessions.  
- Conducted **inferential analyses**:
  - Variance comparison tests (Kruskall_wallis-tests)
  - Effect size calculation (epsilon's squared)
  - Confidence intervals for engagement metrics  
- Used statistical insights to **refine KPI thresholds** and define baselines for experimentation.  

🧠 *Key Concept:* Combining inferential statistics and behavioral analytics to strengthen experimental validity.  

🧰 *Tools:* Python (scipy, statsmodels) · R (tidyverse)  

---

### **5️⃣ Iteration & Design Improvement**
- Conducted iterative feedback sessions with the audiovisual team to **improve dashboard usability and visualization layout**.  
- Adjusted metric visualization to better support storytelling and creative decision-making.  

🧰 *Tools:* Power BI · Power Query · DAX  

---

### **6️⃣ Data Filtering & Tracking**
- Built **multivariable filtering models** in Power BI for dynamic slicing by:
  - Content type
  - Partner
  - Skills
  - Format
  - Competence
  - Time period
- Collaborated with web developers to **add URL tracking parameters**, improving event-level traceability on the landing page.  

🧰 *Tools:* Power BI · Power Query · Web Analytics Integration  

---

### **7️⃣ Experimentation & Pilot Testing**
- Conducted a **pilot experiment** with stakeholders and the audiovisual team:
  - Compared baseline vs. experimental landing versions.
  - Measured behavioral changes in interaction and time-on-page.  
- Delivered a **final product analytics dashboard** used for weekly performance reviews and creative iteration.  

🧰 *Tools:* Power BI · Python · AWS · Excel  

---

## 📊 Results & Impact  

- Established a **reliable data model and dashboard** integrating behavioral, creative, and financial metrics.  
- Reduced reporting turnaround time by **>65%**.  
- Enabled **evidence-based creative decisions** through statistically validated experiments.  
- Increased stakeholder adoption and data literacy within non-technical teams.
